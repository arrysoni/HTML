# 🌐 HTML Learning Project

This repository contains the foundational HTML project I created while learning the core concepts of HTML5. It covers a wide range of HTML elements and best practices, including semantic structure, media handling, forms of text emphasis, lists, tables, internal and external linking, and more.

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

- ✅ **Basic HTML Structure**: Includes `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections with proper use of metadata (`<meta>` tags).
- 🏷️ **Text Elements**: Usage of `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<mark>`, and more for formatting and emphasis.
- 🧠 **Entities**: Demonstrates use of HTML entities like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&copy;`, and `&nbsp;` to display special characters.
- 🔗 **Hyperlinking**:
  - Internal links using `#fragment` syntax.
  - External links with `target="_blank"` to open in new tabs.
  - Mail links using `mailto:`.
- 🖼️ **Media Elements**:
  - Embedded images with `alt` attributes for accessibility.
  - Videos with autoplay, loop, and controls.
  - Basic `<audio>` setup.
- 📝 **Lists**:
  - Unordered (`<ul>`), ordered (`<ol>`), and description lists (`<dl>`).
- 📊 **Tables**: 
  - Well-structured table with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, and styled using CSS.
- 🎨 **CSS Styling**:
  - Internal styles applied for elements like `video`, `ul`, `table`, and custom classes like `.product` and `.highlight`.
- 🧱 **Semantic HTML5 Elements**:
  - Demonstrates the use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<time>`, `<mark>`, `<figure>`, and `<figcaption>`.
- 🧪 **Experimentation**: Includes a variety of examples, best practices, and notes to reinforce learning.
